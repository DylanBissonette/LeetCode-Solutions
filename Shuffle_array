# Intuition
I knew that I would need to use n as a helper to get the index for the y values, 
and that the x values were relatively simple just as the even indices of the array

# Approach
I began with mapping the nums array to my shuffled array on paper for the given 
test case, then I coded this chunk

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
O(n)

- Space complexity:
Also O(n)

# Code
```java []
class Solution {
    public int[] shuffle(int[] nums, int n) {
        int shuffled[] = new int[2 * n];
        // copy x and y values
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) { 
            shuffled[2 * i] = nums[i];
            shuffled[2 * i + 1] = nums[i + n];
        }
        return shuffled;
    }
}
```
